As of June 1, 2017, I have traveled around the world. I left New York on January 18th, headed west, and circled the fucking globe. But I feel ridiculous saying that. Technically, anyone with the cash (or credit) can buy plane tickets and book hostels. It isn’t like I’m Amelia Earhart or a 9 year old girl with a sailboat. So I’m stuck in this weird purgatory where I feel like I did something that was challenging and rewarding and changed me for the better, but every mention of it feels wrong.

I recently came across a picture from my first day in Slovenia and froze, because I suddenly realized just how far I’ve come from the nervous, risk-averse, bullheaded girl I was at that point. But it’s hard to explain and it’s hard to even admit to myself how transformative this was. A year ago I was worried that three weeks of traveling alone would be too much, and look at me now. I honestly have no idea how I did this. Not because it was necessarily difficult to actually go, but because of everything else that gets in the way. Even now, I could leave again, but it’s an absolutely terrifying prospect. I’ll admit that a large part of my leaving was running away, but I ran away in a pretty responsible way.

However, rather than being proud of my accomplishment(s), I find myself discounting them entirely, or at least downplaying them, because of the belief that something so rewarding and enviable, that I wanted to do and wasn’t forced into, and that did not involve an organized tour or work opportunity, could actually be difficult and valuable.

I can’t figure out how to talk about my trip, because making it relatable involves either bragging or lecturing. I’m talking up how great I am: “Yes, it was a hugely brave thing for me to do. I am special. It changed me and my outlook so much,” or I’m lecturing: “No, I’m not special, you could/should totally do it too!”

So I avoid having either conversation. “It was great. I’m so lucky. It’s weird being back.” I’ve completely downplayed how transformative this was, including to myself.

I can’t really argue this, but I have an idea that America is one of the hardest countries to come home to post-adventure. And NY may be the most difficult city.  Everyone wants to know what you do, who you know, what’s your identity, to size you up and decide your value, consciously or not. If it’s fun then you shouldn’t even talk about it. You should talk about how little sleep you’ve gotten in the past week, how miserable you are at work, “Did you travel just to travel?” Yes, I did. But I didn’t spend 5 months at an all inclusive resort. I didn’t stick to hotels in well-traveled, Westernized places. I saw some shit, dammit!

It took me a while to even register that I was really back. The first two weeks were a whirlwind; I had to attend events in two New England states, go back to see my family in Virginia, and declutter/spring clean my entire apartment. But then began the arduous task of acknowledging that I hadn’t suddenly figured out what I want to be when I grow up, that I was in essentially the same position as before I left.

I’ve even done my darnedest to fall back into all my destructive habits, but I kind of can’t. The work that I’ve done on myself somehow fights through. My “lazy slob” days have involved reorganizing my room, deep cleaning my apartment, job applications, web design, writing, cooking, social engagements, volunteer ops. I’m subletting the other room with Airbnb, hosting couch surfers, applying and interviewing for jobs, building new web sites, drinking gallons of iced coffee, working out every day. I get stoned and watch SVU, but I’m also making lists or folding laundry at the same time. It’s like I’m adulating correctly now.

I don’t think traveling actively changed me as much as it unlocked me from the role and identity that I had created for myself after 4 years in the same city. I was so stuck, but all new opportunities felt too much like a complete reinvention that I didn’t fully believe in. Changes that seemed all but impossible in NY came naturally on the road, where each new city was a clean slate. The narrative you give yourself for your life

Concrete examples of this change? 100% I would never have started this site, or TM, if I had stayed home. I’ve already found myself embarrassed and trying to avoid talking about it. Because I don’t see myself as “a writer,” leaving that for my friends who have bylines in the NYTimes (FU, ED).

And “travel bloggers” get a bad rap, sometimes for good reason. I spent the expected amount of time researching before I went to Southeast Asia, and most of this research was done via travel blogs with quality ranging from Travels with Turtle down to “half-assed Wordpress site with four posts and broken links.” Part of me is definitely embarrassed to be starting one myself, but I do think there is a need for more honest conversation in an industry full of glossy bikini photos and #blessed.

It’s also probably the only way I will be able to really process and speak about what just happened to me, and my adjustment to coming home and trying to navigate where to go from here. I may not be a professional writer, but I am a professional rambler and connector of people and ideas. So why not crowd-source my therapy and use this outlet as a way to both share and understand my journey and the fallout?

I’m not a traveler, and I’m not a writer. But maybe now I can be.
